# Git Basics

### git clone
- Git clone is used to replicate a repository from Github
- A clone copies an existing repo this is not a file-based interaction
- A cloned repository has it's own history, manages, it's own files, completely isolated environment from the original repository
### git init

### git branch
##### Reasons to use branches
1. Collaboration: avoid merge conflicts
2. Long Term Development: 
    - If a feature takes 1-2 weeks to develop you should be pushing changes as you work
    - Pushing this developement to master ruins the opportunity for someone else to work on a new feature or revert to an old version in case of issues
3. Multiple Feature Development 
    - If you need to work on 2 features at once, maybe one feature takes less time than expected and is ready to be released
    - If both are on your local master you must go back and remove code for feature 2 or wait to release until both features are completed
        - what if one feature had an issue? Both would need to be reverted
##### how to use:
- Branches are used to make a local copy of cloned respository where changes can be made without affecting master
- This helps keep code safe!
